# AI Documentation Application Profile
The **AI Documentation Application Profile (AIDOC-AP)** is designed to provide a structured, machine-readable model of an AI system and its entire lifecycle. It is built as a modular framework, rooted in established semantic web standards and enhanced with domain-specific concepts from the research material provided. The core of AIDOC-AP is a graph-based representation that captures the provenance of all AI artifacts, the activities that create and modify them, and the agents responsible for those activities.
